          <p>Every first Friday of the month, people gather in the Bryan area near College Station to showcase their businesses through booths and perform various performances. This First Friday in Bryan event typically draws between 2,000 and 8,000 attendees, making it the largest event in the area.</p>
          <p>We go there to spread the gospel! During our street evangelism sessions, we often share Bibles with the Tree of Life Ministry team!</p>
          <p>Our students also perform performances prepared in advance.</p>
